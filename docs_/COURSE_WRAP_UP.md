# 🎓 Course Wrap-up & Conclusion

### Project Summary
Our team successfully developed an **AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System** for the ITAI 2272 Capstone. We utilized the NASA CMAPSS dataset to simulate real-world industrial engine failure.

### Key Achievements
1.  **Data Pipeline**: Built a robust pipeline to ingest, clean, and normalize raw sensor data.
2.  [cite_start]**Modeling**: Achieved a failure prediction accuracy of **~69%** and low prediction latency (**~38ms**), proving the system is viable for real-time use[cite: 2].
3.  **Dashboard**: Deployed a functional Streamlit interface that allows non-technical operators to monitor machine health.

### Future Work
While we met our latency targets, future iterations will focus on:
* Improving RUL prediction accuracy (lowering Mean Absolute Error).
* Integrating more complex sensor fusion techniques.
* Deploying the model to a live edge device for field testing.
